Hello, My name is Hunter Soper, I'm pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science from Oakland University.
My main goal is to just complete school, im debating on pursuing a Masters. 
The reason for this account is to store my work as i learn C++ at Macomb Community College.
I actually haven't coded in awhile and am excited to get back into it.
My best source of contact is soperhunter@gmail.com
